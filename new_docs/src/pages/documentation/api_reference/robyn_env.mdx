## Configuring the server through a configuration file

Batman wanted to configure the server through an environment file. Changing code continously induced the risk of error.


There are some environment variables that Robyn looks out for. e.g. `ROBYN_HOST` and `ROBYN_PORT`.

You can have a `robyn.env` file to load them automatically in your environment.

The server will check for the `robyn.env` file in the root of the project. If it is able to find one, it will parse the environment variables and the set your environment.

e.g. structure

```bash {{title: 'Sample project directory'}}
--project/
  --robyn.env
  --index.py
  ...
```


Sample `robyn.env`

```bash {{ title: 'Sample Robyn.env' }}
ROBYN_PORT=8080
ROBYN_HOST=127.0.0.1
RANDOM_ENV=123
```

To configure the max payload size, you can set the `ROBYN_MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE` environment variable. The default value is `1000000` bytes.

```bash
#robyn.env
ROBYN_MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE=1000000
```

With the web application deployed and running smoothly, Batman had a powerful new tool at his disposal. The Robyn framework had provided him with the flexibility, scalability, and performance needed to create an effective crime-fighting application, giving him a technological edge in his ongoing battle to protect Gotham City.
