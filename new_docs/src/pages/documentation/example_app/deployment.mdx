## Deploying the Application

After thoroughly testing the web application and ensuring that all features were working as expected, Batman decided it was time to deploy it to a production server. He chose to use a robust and scalable platform, ensuring that his application would be available and performant at all times.


```python {{ title: 'Deploying the Application' }}
python app.py --port 8000 --processes=n --workers=m
```

With the web application deployed and running smoothly, Batman had a powerful new tool at his disposal. The Robyn framework had provided him with the flexibility, scalability, and performance needed to create an effective crime-fighting application, giving him a technological edge in his ongoing battle to protect Gotham City.
