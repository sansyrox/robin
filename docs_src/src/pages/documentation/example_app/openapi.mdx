## OpenAPI Docs

After deploying the application, Batman got multiple queries from the users on how to use the endpoints. Robyn showed him how to generate OpenAPI specifications for his application.

Out of the box, the following endpoints are setup for you:

- `/docs` The Swagger UI
- `/openapi.json` The JSON Specification

## How to use?

<!-- TODO: code here -->

With the reference documentation deployed and running smoothly, Batman had a powerful new tool at his disposal. The Robyn framework had provided him with the flexibility, scalability, and performance needed to create an effective crime-fighting application, giving him a technological edge in his ongoing battle to protect Gotham City.
