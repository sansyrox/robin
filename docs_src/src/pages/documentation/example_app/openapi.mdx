  'Welcome to the Robyn API documentation. You will find comprehensive guides and documentation to help you start working with Robyn as quickly as possible, as well as support if you get stuck.'


## OpenAPI Docs a.k.a Swagger (Coming Soon)

After deploying the application, Batman got multiple queries from the users on how to use the endpoints. Robyn showed him how to generate OpenAPI specifications for his application.

Out of the box, the following endpoints are setup for you:

- `/docs` The Swagger UI
- `/openapi.json` The JSON Specification

However, if you don't want to generate the OpenAPI docs, you can disable it by passing `--disable-openapi` flag while starting the application.

```bash
python app.py --disable-openapi
```

## How to use?

- Query Params: The typing for query params can be added as `def get(r: Request, query_params=GetRequestParams)` where `GetRequestParams` is a `TypedDict`
- Path Params are defaulted to string type (ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)

<CodeGroup title="Basic App">

```python {{ title: 'untyped' }}
from typing import TypedDict

from robyn import Robyn, OpenAPI
from robyn.openapi import OpenAPIInfo, Contact, License, ExternalDocumentation, Components


app = Robyn(file_object=__file__)


@app.get("/")
async def welcome():
    """welcome endpoint"""
    return "hi"


class GetRequestParams(TypedDict):
    appointment_id: str
    year: int


@app.get("/api/v1/name", openapi_name="Name Route", openapi_tags=["Name"])
async def get(r, query_params=GetRequestParams):
    """Get Name by ID"""
    return r.query_params


@app.delete("/users/:name", openapi_tags=["Name"])
async def delete(r):
    """Delete Name by ID"""
    return r.path_params


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.start()
```

```python {{ title: 'typed' }}
from typing import TypedDict

from robyn import Robyn, OpenAPI, Request
from robyn.openapi import OpenAPIInfo, Contact, License, ExternalDocumentation, Components

app: Robyn = Robyn(file_object=__file__)


@app.get("/")
async def welcome():
    """welcome endpoint"""
    return "hi"


class GetRequestParams(TypedDict):
    appointment_id: str
    year: int


@app.get("/api/v1/name", openapi_name="Name Route", openapi_tags=["Name"])
async def get(r: Request, query_params=GetRequestParams):
    """Get Name by ID"""
    return r.query_params


@app.delete("/users/:name", openapi_tags=["Name"])
async def delete(r: Request):
    """Delete Name by ID"""
    return r.path_params


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.start()
```

## How does it work with subrouters?

<CodeGroup title="Subrouters">

```python {{ title: 'untyped' }}
from typing import TypedDict

from robyn import SubRouter

subrouter = SubRouter(__name__, prefix="/sub")


@subrouter.get("/")
async def subrouter_welcome():
    """welcome subrouter"""
    return "hiiiiii subrouter"


class SubRouterGetRequestParams(TypedDict):
    _id: int
    value: str


@subrouter.get("/name")
async def subrouter_get(r, query_params=SubRouterGetRequestParams):
    """Get Name by ID"""
    return r.query_params


@subrouter.delete("/:name")
async def subrouter_delete(r):
    """Delete Name by ID"""
    return r.path_params


app.include_router(subrouter)
```

```python {{ title: 'typed' }}
from typing import TypedDict

from robyn import Request, SubRouter

subrouter: SubRouter = SubRouter(__name__, prefix="/sub")


@subrouter.get("/")
async def subrouter_welcome():
    """welcome subrouter"""
    return "hiiiiii subrouter"


class SubRouterGetRequestParams(TypedDict):
    _id: int
    value: str


@subrouter.get("/name")
async def subrouter_get(r: Request, query_params=SubRouterGetRequestParams):
    """Get Name by ID"""
    return r.query_params


@subrouter.delete("/:name")
async def subrouter_delete(r: Request):
    """Delete Name by ID"""
    return r.path_params


app.include_router(subrouter)
```

With the reference documentation deployed and running smoothly, Batman had a powerful new tool at his disposal. The Robyn framework had provided him with the flexibility, scalability, and performance needed to create an effective crime-fighting application, giving him a technological edge in his ongoing battle to protect Gotham City.
