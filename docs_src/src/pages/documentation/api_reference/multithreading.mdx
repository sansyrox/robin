## Variables in Multithreading

Batman wondered about the behavour of variables in a Robyn multiprocessing environment.


<Row>

Any variable used in a multiprocessing environment is shared across multiple processes.

Whilst using multithreading in Robyn, the variables are not protected from multiple threads access by default.

We need the value to be protected within the process, while accessing the count from different threads.

for eg: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Value">`multiprocessing.Value`</a> can be used for achieving the required protection.

    ```python {{ title: 'untyped' }}  
        import threading
        import time
        from multiprocessing import Value

        from robyn import Robyn, Request

        app = Robyn(__file__)

        count = Value("i", 0)

        def counter():
            while True:
                count.value += 1
                time.sleep(0.2)
                print(count.value, "added 1")

        @app.get("/")
        def index(request):
            return f"{count.value}"

        threading.Thread(target=counter, daemon=True).start()

        app.start()
    ```

    ```python {{ title: 'typed' }}
        import threading

        from multiprocessing import Value

        from robyn import Robyn, Request

        app = Robyn(__file__)

        count: Value = Value("i", 0)

        def counter():
            while True:
                count.value += 1
                time.sleep(0.2)
                print(count.value, "added 1")

        @app.get("/")
        def index(request: Request):
            return f"{count.value}"

        threading.Thread(target=counter, daemon=True).start()

        app.start()

## What's next?


Batman wondered if it was possible to use Rust directly from Robyn's codebase.

Robyn showed him the path.
