## Redirection

Batman wanted to redirect some endpoints to others. Robyn helped him do so by the following.

```python {{ title: 'Redirection' }}
from robyn import Robyn

app = Robyn(__file__)

@app.get("/")
def index():
    return landing()

@app.get("/landing")
def landing():
    return "hii!"
```

With increased flexibility achieved by redirection, Batman had a powerful new tool at his disposal. The Robyn framework had provided him with the flexibility, scalability, and performance needed to create an effective crime-fighting application, giving him a technological edge in his ongoing battle to protect Gotham City.
