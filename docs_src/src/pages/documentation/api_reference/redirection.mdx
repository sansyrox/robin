## Redirection

Batman wanted to redirect some endpoints to others. Robyn helped him do so by the following:

<Row>
  <Col>
  </Col>
  <Col sticky>
    <CodeGroup title="Request">

      ```python {{title: 'untyped'}}
      from robyn import Robyn, Response
      app = Robyn(__file__)

      @app.get("/")
      async def index():
        return Response(
          status_code=307,
          description="",
          headers={"Location": "landing"},
        )

      @app.get("/landing")
      def landing():
        return "hii!"
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Col>
</Row>

## What's next?

Now, batman wanted to have an ability to upload files to the server if any new villain appeared. Robyn introduced him to the file uploads feature.
