# API Usage

## Getting Started

```python

from robyn import Robyn

app = Robyn(__file__)

@app.get("/")
async def h():
    return "Hello, world!"

app.start(port=5000, url="0.0.0.0") # url is optional, defaults to 127.0.0.1

```

Let us try to decipher the usage line by line.

> from robyn import Robyn

This statement just imports the Robyn structure from the robyn package.

> app = Robyn(__file__)

Here, we are creating the app object. We require the `__file__` object to mount the directory for hot reloading.

## Running the service

You can just use the command 

```
python3 app.py
```

if you want to run the production version, and

```
python3 app.py --dev=true
```
if you want to enable hot reloading or the development version.

## Serving an HTTP Request


Robyn supports both sync methods and async methods for fetching requests. Every method gets a request object from the routing decorator.

The request object contains the `body` in PUT/POST/PATCH. The `header`s are available in every request object.

Robyn supports every HTTP request method. The examples of some of them are below:
### GET Request

```python3
@app.get("/")
async def h(request):
    return "Hello World"
```

### POST Request

```python3
@app.post("/post")
async def postreq(request):
    return bytearray(request["body"]).decode("utf-8")
```

### PUT Request

```python3
@app.put("/put")
async def postreq(request):
    return bytearray(request["body"]).decode("utf-8")
```


### PATCH Request

```python3
@app.patch("/patch")
async def postreq(request):
    return bytearray(request["body"]).decode("utf-8")
```


### DELETE Request

```python3
@app.delete("/delete")
async def postreq(request):
    return bytearray(request["body"]).decode("utf-8")
```


### Having Dynamic Routes
You can add params in the routes and access them from the request object.

```python3
@app.post("/jsonify/:id")
async def json(request):
    print(request["params"]["id"])
    return jsonify({"hello": "world"})
```

### Query Params

You can access query params from every HTTP method.

For the url: `http://localhost:5000/query?a=b`

You can use the following code snippet.

```python3
@app.get("/query")
async def query_get(request):
    query_data = request["queries"]
    return jsonify(query_data)
```

### Getting URL form data
You can access URL form data with the request object similar to how you access params.

```python3
@app.get("/get")
async def query(request):
    form_data = request.get("queries", {})
    print(form_data)
    return jsonify({"queries": form_data})
```

### Returning a JSON Response
You can also serve JSON responses when serving HTTP request using the following way.

```python3
from robyn import jsonify

@app.post("/jsonify")
async def json(request):
    print(request)
    return jsonify({"hello": "world"})
```

### Serving a Directory
You can also use robyn to serve a directory. An example use case of this method would be when you want to build and serve a react/vue/angular/vanilla js app.

You would type the following command to generate the build directory.
```
    yarn build
```

and you can then add the following method in your robyn app.

```python3
app.add_directory(route="/react_app_serving",directory_path="./build", index_file="index.html")

```


### Serving a Static File

If you don't want to serve static directory and want to just serve static_files, you can use the following method.
```python3
from robyn import Robyn, static_file

@app.get("/test")
async def test():
    return static_file("index.html")

```

### Serving Headers
You can also add global headers for every request.

```python3
app.add_header("server", "robyn")

```

## Events

You can add startup and shutdown events in robyn. These events will execute before the requests have started serving and after the serving has been completed.

```python3

async def startup_handler():
    logger.log(logging.INFO, "Starting up")

app.startup_handler(startup_handler)

@app.shutdown_handler
def shutdown_handler():
    logger.log(logging.INFO, "Shutting down")
```

## WebSockets

You can now serve websockets using Robyn.

Firstly, you need to create a WebSocket Class and wrap it around your Robyn app.

```python3
from robyn import Robyn, static_file, jsonify, WS


app = Robyn(__file__)
websocket = WS(app, "/web_socket")
```

Now, you can define 3 methods for every web_socket for their life cycle, they are as follows:

```python3
@websocket.on("message")
def connect():
    global i
    i+=1
    if i==0:
        return "Whaaat??"
    elif i==1:
        return "Whooo??"
    elif i==2:
        return "*chika* *chika* Slim Shady."
    elif i==3:
        i= -1
        return ""

@websocket.on("close")
def close():
    return "Goodbye world, from ws"

@websocket.on("connect")
def message():
    return "Hello world, from ws"

```

The three methods:
 - "message" is called when the socket receives a message
 - "close" is called when the socket is disconnected
 - "connect" is called when the socket connects

To see a complete service in action, you can go to the folder [../integration_tests/base_routes.py](../integration_tests/base_routes.py)


### Usage

```python3
@websocket.on("message")
async def connect():
    global i
    i+=1
    if i==0:
        return "Whaaat??"
    elif i==1:
        return "Whooo??"
    elif i==2:
        return "*chika* *chika* Slim Shady."
    elif i==3:
        i= -1
        return ""

@websocket.on("close")
async def close():
    return "Goodbye world, from ws"

@websocket.on("connect")
async def message():
    return "Hello world, from ws"

```

## Middlewares

You can use both sync and async functions for middlewares!

```python3
@app.before_request("/")
async def hello_before_request(request):
    print(request)


@app.after_request("/")
def hello_after_request(request):
    print(request)
```

## MultiCore Scaling

To run Robyn across multiple cores, you can use the following command:

`python3 app.py --workers=N --processes=N`
